# The-Smart-City-Management-System-project
 
The Smart City Management System project aims to create a comprehensive platform for overseeing smart buildings and their infrastructure. Each building, with its unique ID, type, location on a smart street, and resident capacity, forms part of the system. To enhance sustainability, these buildings integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Moreover, each apartment is equipped with a sensor node containing motion, temperature, and humidity sensors, alongside a microcontroller and communication module. Alongside these sensor nodes, apartments feature various smart appliances, such as heaters and air conditioners, connected to switches and smart meters for power consumption monitoring. Although non-smart appliances may be present, they are not integrated into the system.

The system caters to two primary user categories: General Admin and Residents. General Admin possesses extensive privileges, including managing city aspects like adding buildings, streets, apartments, and sensor nodes, accessing sensor data, and handling resident profiles/accounts. They log in using unique credentials and are responsible for managing resident reports, which they communicate offline to relevant organizations. Conversely, Residents have their own profiles with personal details like ID, name, contact information, and address. They can access sensor data in their apartments, control appliances, and report issues. These reports are managed by the General Admin, who liaises with appropriate parties for resolution. Residents access the system through individual accounts, using login credentials, and can manage their accounts by changing usernames and passwords.
